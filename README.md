# rl-biological-network
The objective of this project is to control/perturb the system so that the state values of all components become 1 (ON) at all time steps (i.e., continuing task). In other words, the system (a well-known biological network, the p53-Mdm2 negative feedback loop network) is desired to have as many active components as possible (ideally, spend most of the time on the state “1111”).

The goal of this project was to understand two reinforcement learning methods to obtain the optimal policy, such as matrix-form value iteration and matrix-form policy iteration.
